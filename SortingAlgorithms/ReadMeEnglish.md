# Sorting Algorithms

The files named `ejercicio1.cpp` and `ejercicio2.cpp` implement Merge Sort and Quick Sort respectively. These implementations are made as templates so that you can sort any type of data
with any type of function to compare such data that you want.

The file named `ejercicio3.cpp` has a testing of this algorithms first in real numbers and then in 2-tuples of real numbers. The comparison functions for this tuples are defined there. The 
sorting algorithms run with a first entry (of the tuples) comparing function and also with a second entry comparison function.
