The files named `p00.cpp` and `p01.cpp` have implementations of the stack and queue structures respectively as linked lists. They use a Nodo (Node) structure for this purpose.

### p02.cpp

This script solves the problem of determining if a string of brackets and parenthesis is correctly written. The script uses stacks for this.

### p03.cpp

This script solves the problem of determining the number of river crossings that a boat has to make in order to carry cars from either side of the river to 
the other side. This is made given the lengths of cars at both sides of the river and the length of the boat. The script uses queues for this.
